This was the first of many trips I would make through my life to various institutions of research to dig up the truth of the simple yet terrifying legend of the Seed Man."/>

            <ITEXT CH="We started with excerpts and fragments that we could find about the Mohegan tribes from the area but found very little that was useful. Before the seventeenth century, the Mohegan were part of the Pequot tribe. Granted independence as a sovereign nation after helping defeat the English during the Prequot War in 1638 a reservation was established on the Thames River in Uncasville. Most of what we could find was historical, very little biographical or anecdotal information could be dug up in our small towns library. We did manage to find the names of a few tribal elders who were still alive and living on the reservation. We put a visit to the Mohegan Indian Reservation on our list of possible leads and moved on to histories about the town of Harrow Glen. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="Harrows Field was established in 1640 by Wilbur Smythe, Thomas Becker and Johnathan Waitley, a small field split into 3 sections to which each man laid claim. They had no trouble with local tribes due to the irrational fear that the local tribes had for the narrow glen nestled between the dark forbidding mountain forests. There was mention of a tribal chief that came to warn the three men of an evil spirit that resided in the deepest woods near the glen. This was sited as the beginning of the local legends in the area of a windego type creature that took people away in the night. This was the only information we could find that seemed connected to the Seed Man before the accounts of missing children in 1643 and the story of Connel Saybrook which Stan had already related to me. It gave me an eerie feeling to read in the pages of legitimately published works the same account that Stan had laid out. A feeling of dread came over me as I began to realize that this was not just a fun little adventure or flight of fancy cooked up by two young boys to fill the summer days. This was real and quite possibly deadly, for if what we suspected was true, the Seed Man was coming for Stan and possibly me by association. After wringing out all we could at the library we decided to head home. It was getting close to dinner time and we needed to secure another sleepover to protect Stan on the coming night."/>

With wide eyes we crouched at the window to my bedroom squinting in the darkness to see what had the dog up in arms. We could not see anything in the blackness of the forest by the scarce moonlight, but there was a feeling as we stared at the spot in the black wall of trees that the dog was focused on that something was there staring back at us. It was such an overwhelming feeling that both of us jumped back from the window. We jumped into my bed and hide under the covers as if the blankets could somehow shield us from the thing lurking at the edge of the forest. After some time we both fell asleep from exhaustion and the night passed on into morning. My mother was surprised to find us sleeping in the same bed when she came to rouse us for breakfast the next morning. Whatever she may have thought she did not inquire out it at the breakfast table."/>

Our plans however were cut short when my father returned early from work with some tragic news from the mines. They were digging some new tunnels and my father was examining the sedimentary layers in the freshly dug walls when a deep cavern opened up under the men on the front line. My father heard a crumbling sound as the floor gave way under four men digging on the front line. They disappeared quickly into the pitch black maw that opened up beneath them. My father was visibly shaken as he related the events. He said he could hear the men’s screams for a few agonizing seconds before they were silenced. “It must be hundreds of feet deep” he said looking into the palms of his hands. There was no time to catch them he said, he was close but it happened in an instant. As he said the last he looked up at Stan and said quietly, “I’m so sorry son”. Stan knew immediately what that meant and took off running to his house yelling for his mother. Stan’s father and three other men were lost that day and presumed dead. That section of the tunnel was closed off  as no one believed that there was any reason to go down in that hole to find them. My father, who was near obsessed about exploring the open cavern and finding the men that it claimed, was the only one who was willing to investigate.  The other miners and the management felt it was too dangerous to peruse a lost cause, and so it became my father’s secret project."/>

It was good that we lived in such a small town since Stan had to take over the monetary responsibilities for the family though he was only twelve years old. Everyone in town knew the story and tried to help Stan as much as they could. Meanwhile Stan and I were in a battle for his very soul, without any parental supervision we were free to explore our fantasies however wild and imagined. We were devising a plan to end the Seed Man once and for all, ridding the town if the evil thing and bringing peace to the community at long last. "/>

My father began spending more time at the mines, staying on after hours so that he could examine the rock formations and sedimentary patters around the cavern. He told me in passing that things just didn’t add up. He had taken numerous readings and samples from the location and was sure there were no caverns, especially of that size in the area. My mother was permissive of my fathers obsessed behavior because as she told me one night before he came home, he must have felt terrible guilt over the accident for it was his reports that cleared the site for digging. It was something my father said late one night that led me in a new direction in our Seed Man investigation. I passed by the family room late one night to get some water and I overheard my father absently thinking out loud. He was saying that it made no sense for the cavern to be there. It was as if something had created this cavern from below after he had taken his initial readings. He also wondered aloud how a cavern that big could possibly be created in that short amount of time. It was impossible according to my father. Stan and I were taking a much less scientific approach to our investigation however and to us the impossible was the basis for our entire inquiry. It was not impossible to assume that a centuries old mythical monster could be responsible for the cavern. This strange occurrence must certainly be connected to the Seed Man we needed only to figure out how."/>

Once the sun began its downward climb we started back home. Stan was sad but was also not too concerned since Wolf had run off like this before. Probably looking for a female to spend the summer evening with we joked. We were about a half mile from home when we noticed a small clearing in the woods which had the most peculiar indention running through the tall grass. The grass was flattened along a twisting path through the clearing. The depression was about 3 feet across and curved threw the grass as if some gigantic snake had slithered through. There was a mucus type substance on the trampled grass. It had a horrible odor and was greasy to the touch. Neither of us said what we were thinking but we both were relieved to move on from the clearing. Our pace quickened as the light dimmed and we made it home just after dusk both of us panting and sweating from the brisk pace we had been keeping since we saw the unusual tracks in the clearing. That night Stan had another nightmare and again the sound of seeds shaking in a paper sack followed after he woke. Stan ran out of his house and scurried up the tree outside my window calling to me to let him in. I let him in and tried to calm him down. We spent the rest of the night staring out the window into the dark woods for any sign of movement. There was none and eventually we fell asleep from exhaustion. "/>

It wasn’t until my father invited us to come with him to the university that he was doing research for that we gained a break in the case. The library at the university was vast and held many volumes that were deemed inappropriate for most public libraries in the area. We found histories, census logs, personal letters and memoirs and old newspapers that dated back further than what we had previously found. We spent the two days in the library doing research, my father thought we were crazy and tried many times to get us to come with him to see the town. I told him that Stan and I had never had access to this many books before and being a book worm himself he understood. He himself was doing his own research at night when he thought we had gone to bed. We instead were devising our plans and going over the days research instead of getting proper sleep."/>

            <ITEXT CH="We had mapped out all of the missing persons reports that we could foresee being related to the Seed Man. We then narrowed that down further by removing any one over a specific age. We set the limit at twelve years of age since that was our age and for all the stories Stan could remember, none of the children taken were that old and certainly not older. We began to notice a strange pattern. The reports of missing persons and claims of the Seed Man would generally come up every several years however there was no distinct pattern to the re-occurrences of the phenomenon. It seemed utterly random however one thing did not seem to be random. The ages of the children taken seem to be increasing. The earliest record we could find was of babies being taken from the Mohegan tribes. Each re-occurrence had the age of the victims increased. From one event to another it was hard to distinguish this oddity but when you put the time line out over a longer span of time you could see that the ages were increasing. We could not puzzle out why that could be but we each had our own theories. The trip was invaluable and the information we acquired was much to be pondered. My father seemed a bit dismayed to head back home and it seemed as though he had found something in his own research that had caused a change in him. After that trip my father seemed to be a bit less himself, a bit more distracted and scatterbrained. On the last day we saw him talking at length to the university head librarian Dr. Armitage and they both had the look on their faces as if they had seen a ghost. The trip home was a quiet ride as nobody was willing to speak, all of us lost in our own minds trying to puzzle out what we had learned. "/>

Stan being the ultimate bait and we had the run of his house now that his mother had descended into debilitating grief over the loss of her husband. I spent most nights at Stan’s house which was tolerated by my mother since she felt bad for Stan being alone and taking care of his grieving mother. Our plan was to have Stan in his usual room while I was in the spare bedroom next to his. I would monitor his sleep and attempt to capture on phonograph the sounds of the Seed Man if he made an appearance. We found that though the visits were consistent they were not sequential, this led us to believe that this creature was intelligent in some way. It knew when Stan was not in the house and it was careful not to come calling when Wolf was out in the yard. Since Wolf’s disappearance there was less protection from the nightly visits but when it did come it was always the same. It came when Stan was asleep and it was gone once he woke from a nightmare. No matter how we tried it somehow knew if I was awake while Stan slept. So we planed to have me hidden away and only recording sound not trying to get a glimpse, we were hoping that this would catch the nocturnal specter unaware and give us our first real proof that the Seed Man was not just a child’s tale but a corporeal monstrosity that walks among us."/>

Stan’s mental state had been deteriorating slowly since the first night he suspected that the Seed Man had visited him. He was generally more irritable and was getting more and more scatterbrained as the days wore on. It had been a month since the first occurrence and we counted that he had been visited at least 15 times now. We had mitigated the number of visits by having Wolf in the back yard, until he went missing and having Stan stay the night at my house. Tonight was the first step in tracking the beast to ground and once we located it’s lair, destroying the thing in whatever way we could. After much deliberation Stan went off to his room tired and ready for the nights events. I was in the next room and tasked to stay awake and begin the recording device when I believed that something had entered Stan’s room. We had assured that his door was slightly closed and provided enough of a creak when opened that I would be alerted of an intruder. With butterflies in my stomach I sat in a chair next to the wall adjacent to his room listening intently for the tell tale creaking of his bedroom door."/>

I was half in a dream as I heard the tell tale creak of the door to the room beside me. My eyes shot open and I fought the urge to call out as I heard a sound which was familiar to me after the many times hearing the legendary tale of the Seed Man. It was a bit more organic than I had imagined and had a damp gurgling to it that suggested things which I dared not think in the post midnight darkness. It was unmistakably the sound of seeds being shaken inside of a paper sack. The near full moon’s light shown through the window falling on the phonograph which I was to use in recording the sound of the thing. I shook myself out of the trance I had fallen into while listening to the sound and hurried over to turn on the device. "/>

Maybe it was a need to protect Stan from this nocturnal fiend or the need to know what it was that tormented us for these last weeks but regardless of the reason my feet, as if not under my own control, led me out into the hallway and over to pear into the open doorway of Stan’s room. Through the dim moonlight spilling into the curtained window I saw a figure standing over Stan. Fully 6 to 7 feet tall and oddly uniform in thickness from the base to the head. I assumed that the darkness was casing strange shadows, which made the form difficult to reconcile in my mind. From the floor its thick black mass stayed uniform until the upper part of the body which tapered into a sort of head although the entire thing seemed to be one single mass like a giant slug. At the top were several moving tendrils, which seemed to writhe randomly in the moonlight as if testing the air about them. It bent down closer to Stan and seemed to be excreting something from its tendrils into Stan’s slightly open mouth. I gasped at this and the thing shifted in the darkness, it whirled around to face me and in the dim light I could barely make out the outline of it’s face which was dominated by one large circular maw lined with 3 rows of needle like teeth. It did not appear to have eyes that I could tell nor any other recognizable facial features. It let out a squealing sound that shot through my mind like electricity and rendered me unconscious in an instant. When I came too it was Stan who was standing over me asking what had happened. I could only get out three words before I again lost consciousness and I saw the terror on Stan’s face as I groaned out  “He was here” then fell once again into blackness."/>

We listened to the recording and heard it all, the tell tail sound of seeds shaking in a paper sack and the squeal that rendered me unconscious.  Listening to the latter caused us both to relieve our stomachs of their contents. We now had the prof and as we walked out into the backyard to look for possible clues we were confronted with another horror. We found a trail leading from the back door out into the woods, the trail was identical to the one we had found in the forest clearing when looking for Wolf several weeks back. Our course was laid out for us at that point, we needed to follow this trail to ground and possibly find the ancient hidden lair of this mythical monstrosity and once found destroy the beast with all the fury we could muster. We could not let fear get the better of us, this was a matter of life and death for Stan and possibly myself as well now that the thing had seen me observe it’s nightly machinations. As we set to strike off after the beast my father rounded the corner and called for us to yield. With wild hair and wrinkled sweat stained clothes he came to us and said. “I know about that thing you have been searching for, I know this terrible secret and this is the day we will end this”."/>

Stan fell in line behind me a moment later. None of us spoke a word as we entered the woods and it was another half an hour before anyone spoke at all. We passed the clearing that Stan and I had encountered previously and I took a mental note of the precise location. I thought this could be a potential ambush spot since we had see evidence that the thing had used this path before. It was a full hour before we found our quarry.  The trail lead to a cliff wall that extended well over the height of the trees, however it was not possible to see the top of the cliff from our location beneath the canopy.  A single fissure that ran horizontally from the ground to a height of about forty feet marred the cliff face. It reminded me of a scare scratched into the cliff by some gigantic claw. At its base the opening was about three to 4 feet wide with nothing but pitch-blackness beyond. We had one flashlight among us, which my father wielded with the expertise of a veteran geologist. No stranger to the dark depths of the earth was my father, and his presence was a steading force for Stan and I. Not a word was spoken as we descended into the Stygian depths bracing ourselves for the horrors that we knew must lay in wait within the inky blackness."/>

Calcium deposits covered the cavern making the walls look like the skeletal insides of some huge beast as our single flashlight paned across them. The darkness was oppressive and the humidity soon made our clothes damp and heavier on our bodies. There was only one tunnel leading steadily downward with no other openings on either side. The floor was surprisingly easy to navigate, as it seems it had been worn smooth through years of slowly running condensation.

We could see that the cave, which we stood in, was in danger of collapse.  Before we could react several boils appeared on the surface of the thing rising up then bursting to reveal what looked like giant slug type creatures with thick slime covered bodies with clusters of writhing appendages at the top. It looked like an anemone in the location that appeared to be its head. Scores of these burst out of the host thing and began moving towards us. They were terrifyingly fast as they climbed the shear walls of the crevasse and were upon us almost instantly. The first to crest the lip of the ledge on which we stood shot out several of its appendages which wrapped quickly around Stan’s head and shoulders and pull him to itself. Then as quickly as it came it returned back into the pit with Stan. In an instant Stan was gone, this was the last I would ever see of my faithful childhood friend. My father turned to me and screamed for me to run. I stood frozen in terror as he reached into his pants pocket for that which he intentionally had concealed there. In the moment I knew that my father must have been researching the same phenomenon we were but from a different angle entirely.  He knew where we were heading and what we would find there and he was prepared to deal with it. His hand moved from his pocket to bring up a stick of dynamite. Handing me the flashlight he drew a lighter from his breast pocket, lite the fuse and screamed from me to run. This broke my catatonia and my legs began moving before my mind had made out what was happening. It seemed as in slow motion as I ran for the tunnel entrance. Moving as fast as I could, the light of my flashlight pointing wildly about the darkness of the cave. As I stumbled out of the entrance I heard a defining whip crack sound of the dynamite as it exploded. It was only seconds before the cave began to fall in on itself sending a rush of dirt and rock out after me. I ran and did not stop, driven by terror and my father’s last words. I made it almost the whole way back home before I collapsed in the dirt and darkness surrounded me. "/>

I went to the attic immediately and searched threw old boxes for what might be left of my fathers research. I found a bound leather folder in a box at the far corner of the attic and opened it.

It was a match, each event started with seismic activity followed by some sort of cave-in somewhere on the mountain, then promptly followed by tales of missing children. This tracked with everything Stan and I had found about the events of missing children in the area with the exception that we had found the ages of the missing children had increased over the years. The conclusion my father came to was that something was being unearthed when these seismic events took place. The rock in the area would crack and open new avenues for whatever this thing was to access the world above. My father believed it was some sort of parasite that preyed on human beings and hypothesized that it could be thousands of years old. I in turn hypothesized that somehow it was feeding on the intellect of it’s victims, gaining knowledge with each passing event allowing it to infect the minds of more developed hosts. It seemed to me that the slug like detachments of the thing were using some sort of organic poison to cause nightmares in its victims that would break down their grip on reality until it was able to call them to it. It had to start with younger minds because they were more easily stripped of their grip on reality. As it gained more knowledge it would be able to develop more complex dreamscapes which could work on more evolved minds.

            <ITEXT CH="In a horror game like Call of Cthulhu the atmosphere is the greatest tool that a keeper has to create a good scary game session. Since Call of Cthulhu tends to focus more on the story being told than the heroic advancement of individual characters it is important to give the players an engaging atmosphere that they remember rather than items of power and experience for the next session. There are physical tools to provide some of this for you however there is nothing more important than giving the players a descriptive and vibrant world in which to ply their trade. An obvious addition to a gaming session is sound. Background music and possibly atmospheric background sound, like a storm, ocean waves or wind can really set the mood. Props are also a good way to give the players a feeling of attachment to the story. Newspaper clippings that are in real newsprint to hold as they read them or possibly a mocked up photograph that the players can pass around are great props that can give the players the feeling that they themselves are taking part in the story and allow them to immerse themselves into their characters."/>

            <ITEXT CH=" Sounds and physical props are great but that is only going to get you so far in a game session. Providing tension to your session is not always easy especially when you have players who are joking around and talking out of character a lot. I am not going to discus ways to solve the situations mentioned but as a keeper you should already be pretty good at getting your players back on task. One quick suggestion on bringing the tension to a group that is talking and joking out of character is to give them two quick pieces of information, the first being mundane and the second being important or being something that the characters must react to. The first piece of information can be missed but the players will notice you are talking about in game facts, the second will be perceived by virtue of getting their attention from the first. For example, the players are entering a dark room with their flashlights trained into the darkness. Someone tells a quick joke about the last time they entered a dark room in this fashion. Everyone is laughing and having a good time. The keeper suddenly says your flashlight passes over a figure crouching in the dark corner. “What” some of the players are saying, the keeper then quickly says “The figure moves out of the light and scurries across the floor to the far end of the room”. Suddenly everyone is either interested in what is happening or at least telling the rest of the group to quiet down so they can hear what is happening. This works for me most of the time and it gets everyone back on track. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="Now that the players are back in focus on the game we can begin to build the tension of the scene. One thing that I use quite a bit is dramatic pausing. So in our example some figure has now moved out of the light and off to a deeper part of the room. Everyone is asking questions now,  “What was that”, “Was it a person”, “Which way did it go”, “What did it look like”. At this point I like to let them stew for a few moments and say nothing, then slowly bring in some subtle detail, like a sound they hear or a feeling. “You hear singing coming from the far left corner of the room, very low but audible singing”. Then hold their attention with repetition of the sound a few times, do it a few times more than you would want to normally, lulling them into a sense that the sound is the key to focus on, at this point hit them with the reveal. When you explain the reveal make sure to do so in rapid succession to give the impression of a situation unfolding quickly and instilling the urgency to make quick actions. For example if we are using the singing example come up with a little tune that you are singing over and over. Let it go over and over a bit too long, suddenly call out several actions in succession. “You feel a rush of wind coming towards you, a figure is revealed in beam of your flashlight, you see a face before you, player X is knocked to the floor!”… “what do you do”.  What I am usually looking for here is a jump scare, its always fun to have your players jump or call out when they are startled. I may be evil but if I can get one or two jump scares in a scenario I feel like I am doing a good job. The key is to lull the players into a false sense of security in knowing what is coming next by giving them repetition, singing the song over and over makes them believe the line of the song is coming again when you change it up quickly it has a startling or jarring effect. It doesn’t have to be a sound being repeated however it could be an explanation of scenery or the description of what someone is doing. As long as you lead them down a path that seems to be the focus then pull the rug out from under them and come at them with something different. The jump scare is great but you can’t use it too often or it will lose its impact."/>

            <ITEXT CH="Another technique that I use quite often is time-based tension. Setup a situation where it is clear that something will happen soon, preferably something undesired like the monster will show up, the person whose house your are breaking  into will be home soon, anything that has a negative consequence. Then create a task that takes a prescribed amount of time and ends with some skill roll. State that the task at hand will take X amount of time to complete. Then begin to make the player roll a series of luck, or some other rolls that they will begin to perceive as the roll that brings the undesired consequence. If they make all the rolls then have them make the final skill roll to complete the task, if they do they have succeeded and can move on.  If however they fail they either begin again or abandon the task. The repeated rolls will in fact bring the undesired consequence, which the players probably have figured out, and so as time goes on each roll brings more tension. A quick example would be this. “You attempt to open the mechanical safe in the cult leaders office, you can do that however it will take an hour for you to complete your task and require a successful mechanical repair roll.” “OK, we do that” “OK, 15 minutes have passed give me a party luck roll”, “passed”, “Another 15 minutes pass give me a party luck roll”, “passed, oh man this guys going to come back while we are here, hurry up and get that thing open”, “Another 15 minutes pass give me a party luck roll”, “Oh no we better make this roll, passed we have to hurry”, “Another 15 minutes pass make me another party luck roll”, “Oh no here we go, passed, thank goodness”, “make me a mechanical repair roll”, “failed, oh man lets get out of here before we get caught”.  Time based tension is great because it gets the players cheering for each other to accomplish the task and if they succeed it gives a feeling of relief and accomplishment."/>

            <ITEXT CH="My personal favorite is what I call the unknown tension. We establish that there is something in a location that is very dangerous and very stealthy. It is impossible to know if this thing is currently at the location or if it is elsewhere. Since we have no way to confirm its whereabouts we can assume that it is in the same location as the players. Now our reluctant hero’s have to investigate the abandoned warehouse full well knowing that this is the last known location of the thing. They roam from room to room expecting the worst as each door opens. At this point you have your players right where you want them. If the thing is actually here, well then we will eventually find it or it will find us. If it is not here the players don’t know so will assume that it is. Any sound, movement from a dark corner, wind blowing through will now set the players off into a frenzy of panic and if you time your reveal right you can get a good quality jump scare out of this as well. Fear of the unknown is more powerful than something you can see and evaluate. This is the basis of most Call of Cthulhu scenarios so play up the unknown and keep up the tension as much as possible.

            <ITEXT CH="Isolation is another great way to create tension in your games. It is always good to isolate the players from the rest of society and any mundane systems of help and protection. Since Call of Cthulhu deals with fantastic creatures and situations you already have a bit of isolation from society available from the beginning. The players can’t just tell others what they have seen for risk of being committed. This removes them from society and puts them on an island to themselves. It is important to continue to further isolate your players by either environment “there is a storm and the roads are out” actions “you are illegally trespassing in the old mansion so you can’t call the police” circumstance “your in the basement, the thing is in the house above you, you see someone walking down the street above through the small cellar window, but if you call out the thing will find you” location “There is no electricity or phones in this old cabin”. Whatever the case may be the more isolated the players are the more tension this will create. There are no avenues to get help and so they are on their own. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="There are many ways to create tension in a game much more than I’ve presented here but I have tried to provide a few that can be achieved easily with the game mechanics. Keeping the players tense and on their toes makes for a truly intense game session that your players will not soon forget. Remember in Call of Cthulhu the story is the important part, creating a good amount of tension will drive that story to its horrible conclusion and along the way create memorable player interactions which wont soon be forgotten. I hope these techniques are useful to Keepers, or at least entertaining to read about. I am sure that the many great Keepers of Arcane Lore have multitudes of ways to create tension and fear in their scenarios, I’d love to hear from you."/>
