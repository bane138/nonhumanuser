Being only eight years old didn’t help, but damn, the idea of the thing kept me up for weeks after. It was Stanley Whitestone who spilled out the local legend as we sat in our treetop hideaway that summer evening.  While the woods behind my new house began to darken he told me the story with quivering lips and sweat beads on his upper lip. Not that Stan was a particularly brave individual but the way he visibly shook, the way his eyes got glassy with tears you would think he had seen the thing with his own eyes. I guess it haunted all of the children in Willow Glen, the adults too I suppose, but it wasn’t until I found out the truth about The Seed Man that the true horror took hold in my mind."/>

Since school was not in I didn’t get a lot of opportunities to meet any new friends. Stan lived next door so we became fast friends. I probably would have ended up Stan’s friend regardless of his proximity since he was a lot like me. We both were bit shy, interested in less than popular topics and not quite as athletic as the other boys our age.

The area was considered forsaken by the Mohegan, an evil place, which was avoided until white settlers came and claimed the area. Its fertile soil, its abundance of water from the rivers and streams and the rich ore deposits in the surrounding mountains made this an ideal place to establish a community. A small town was founded in the glen called Harrows Field. It would later gain the moniker Sorrows Field due to several tragedies that occurred while the town was being built up.

Some said the victim’s soul was trapped in the land of dreams to become legions for the Seed Man who would then torment his future prey. Some said that the Seed Man would bring his victims to his lair in the dark woods where he would devourer them body and soul.

The breastbones of the bodies had the same hole in the precise area above the heart. Some of the remains found were very old and perhaps dated back several hundred years.

They had no trouble with local tribes due to the irrational fear that the local tribes had for the narrow glen nestled between the dark forbidding mountain forests. There was mention of a tribal chief that came to warn the three men of an evil spirit that resided in the deepest woods near the glen. This was sited as the beginning of the local legends in the area of a windego type creature that took people away in the night. This was the only information we could find that seemed connected to the Seed Man before the accounts of missing children in 1643 and the story of Connel Saybrook which Stan had already related to me. It gave me an eerie feeling to read in the pages of legitimately published works the same account that Stan had laid out. A feeling of dread came over me as I began to realize that this was not just a fun little adventure or flight of fancy cooked up by two young boys to fill the summer days. This was real and quite possibly deadly, for if what we suspected was true, the Seed Man was coming for Stan and possibly me by association.

He said he could hear the men’s screams for a few agonizing seconds before they were silenced. “It must be hundreds of feet deep” he said looking into the palms of his hands. There was no time to catch them he said, he was close but it happened in an instant. As he said the last he looked up at Stan and said quietly, “I’m so sorry son”.

He told me in passing that things just didn’t add up. He had taken numerous readings and samples from the location and was sure there were no caverns, especially of that size in the area. My mother was permissive of my fathers obsessed behavior because as she told me one night before he came home, he must have felt terrible guilt over the accident for it was his reports that cleared the site for digging. It was something my father said late one night that led me in a new direction in our Seed Man investigation. I passed by the family room late one night to get some water and I overheard my father absently thinking out loud. He was saying that it made no sense for the cavern to be there. It was as if something had created this cavern from below after he had taken his initial readings. He also wondered aloud how a cavern that big could possibly be created in that short amount of time. It was impossible according to my father. Stan and I were taking a much less scientific approach to our investigation however and to us the impossible was the basis for our entire inquiry.

There was a mucus type substance on the trampled grass. It had a horrible odor and was greasy to the touch. Neither of us said what we were thinking but we both were relieved to move on from the clearing. Our pace quickened as the light dimmed and we made it home just after dusk both of us panting and sweating from the brisk pace we had been keeping since we saw the unusual tracks in the clearing.

We began to notice a strange pattern. The reports of missing persons and claims of the Seed Man would generally come up every several years however there was no distinct pattern to the re-occurrences of the phenomenon. It seemed utterly random however one thing did not seem to be random. The ages of the children taken seem to be increasing. The earliest record we could find was of babies being taken from the Mohegan tribes. Each re-occurrence had the age of the victims increased. From one event to another it was hard to distinguish this oddity but when you put the time line out over a longer span of time you could see that the ages were increasing. We could not puzzle out why that could be but we each had our own theories. The trip was invaluable and the information we acquired was much to be pondered.

I would monitor his sleep and attempt to capture on phonograph the sounds of the Seed Man if he made an appearance. We found that though the visits were consistent they were not sequential, this led us to believe that this creature was intelligent in some way. It knew when Stan was not in the house and it was careful not to come calling when Wolf was out in the yard. Since Wolf’s disappearance there was less protection from the nightly visits but when it did come it was always the same. It came when Stan was asleep and it was gone once he woke from a nightmare. No matter how we tried it somehow knew if I was awake while Stan slept. So we planed to have me hidden away and only recording sound not trying to get a glimpse, we were hoping that this would catch the nocturnal specter unaware and give us our first real proof that the Seed Man was not just a child’s tale but a corporeal monstrosity that walks among us."/>

            <ITEXT CH="We stayed up fairly late that night discussing our plans for the evening. Stan was nervous and seemed more jumpy than usual. Stan’s mental state had been deteriorating slowly since the first night he suspected that the Seed Man had visited him. He was generally more irritable and was getting more and more scatterbrained as the days wore on. It had been a month since the first occurrence and we counted that he had been visited at least 15 times now. We had mitigated the number of visits by having Wolf in the back yard, until he went missing and having Stan stay the night at my house. Tonight was the first step in tracking the beast to ground and once we located it’s lair, destroying the thing in whatever way we could. After much deliberation Stan went off to his room tired and ready for the nights events. I was in the next room and tasked to stay awake and begin the recording device when I believed that something had entered Stan’s room. We had assured that his door was slightly closed and provided enough of a creak when opened that I would be alerted of an intruder. With butterflies in my stomach I sat in a chair next to the wall adjacent to his room listening intently for the tell tale creaking of his bedroom door."/>

I was half in a dream as I heard the tell tale creak of the door to the room beside me. My eyes shot open and I fought the urge to call out as I heard a sound which was familiar to me after the many times hearing the legendary tale of the Seed Man. It was a bit more organic than I had imagined and had a damp gurgling to it that suggested things which I dared not think in the post midnight darkness. It was unmistakably the sound of seeds being shaken inside of a paper sack. The near full moon’s light shown through the window falling on the phonograph which I was to use in recording the sound of the thing. I shook myself out of the trance I had fallen into while listening to the sound and hurried over to turn on the device. "/>

Maybe it was a need to protect Stan from this nocturnal fiend or the need to know what it was that tormented us for these last weeks but regardless of the reason my feet, as if not under my own control, led me out into the hallway and over to pear into the open doorway of Stan’s room. Through the dim moonlight spilling into the curtained window I saw a figure standing over Stan. Fully 6 to 7 feet tall and oddly uniform in thickness from the base to the head. I assumed that the darkness was casing strange shadows, which made the form difficult to reconcile in my mind. From the floor its thick black mass stayed uniform until the upper part of the body which tapered into a sort of head although the entire thing seemed to be one single mass like a giant slug. At the top were several moving tendrils, which seemed to writhe randomly in the moonlight as if testing the air about them. It bent down closer to Stan and seemed to be excreting something from its tendrils into Stan’s slightly open mouth. I gasped at this and the thing shifted in the darkness, it whirled around to face me and in the dim light I could barely make out the outline of it’s face which was dominated by one large circular maw lined with 3 rows of needle like teeth. It did not appear to have eyes that I could tell nor any other recognizable facial features. It let out a squealing sound that shot through my mind like electricity and rendered me unconscious in an instant. When I came too it was Stan who was standing over me asking what had happened. I could only get out three words before I again lost consciousness and I saw the terror on Stan’s face as I groaned out  “He was here” then fell once again into blackness."/>

We listened to the recording and heard it all, the tell tail sound of seeds shaking in a paper sack and the squeal that rendered me unconscious.  Listening to the latter caused us both to relieve our stomachs of their contents. We now had the prof and as we walked out into the backyard to look for possible clues we were confronted with another horror. We found a trail leading from the back door out into the woods, the trail was identical to the one we had found in the forest clearing when looking for Wolf several weeks back. Our course was laid out for us at that point, we needed to follow this trail to ground and possibly find the ancient hidden lair of this mythical monstrosity and once found destroy the beast with all the fury we could muster. We could not let fear get the better of us, this was a matter of life and death for Stan and possibly myself as well now that the thing had seen me observe it’s nightly machinations. As we set to strike off after the beast my father rounded the corner and called for us to yield. With wild hair and wrinkled sweat stained clothes he came to us and said. “I know about that thing you have been searching for, I know this terrible secret and this is the day we will end this”."/>

Stan fell in line behind me a moment later. None of us spoke a word as we entered the woods and it was another half an hour before anyone spoke at all. We passed the clearing that Stan and I had encountered previously and I took a mental note of the precise location. I thought this could be a potential ambush spot since we had see evidence that the thing had used this path before. It was a full hour before we found our quarry.  The trail lead to a cliff wall that extended well over the height of the trees, however it was not possible to see the top of the cliff from our location beneath the canopy.  A single fissure that ran horizontally from the ground to a height of about forty feet marred the cliff face. It reminded me of a scare scratched into the cliff by some gigantic claw. At its base the opening was about three to 4 feet wide with nothing but pitch-blackness beyond. We had one flashlight among us, which my father wielded with the expertise of a veteran geologist. No stranger to the dark depths of the earth was my father, and his presence was a steading force for Stan and I. Not a word was spoken as we descended into the Stygian depths bracing ourselves for the horrors that we knew must lay in wait within the inky blackness."/>

Calcium deposits covered the cavern making the walls look like the skeletal insides of some huge beast as our single flashlight paned across them. The darkness was oppressive and the humidity soon made our clothes damp and heavier on our bodies. There was only one tunnel leading steadily downward with no other openings on either side. The floor was surprisingly easy to navigate, as it seems it had been worn smooth through years of slowly running condensation. We had gone in several hundred yards which seemed to account for at least a descent of around 200 or so feet when we heard a strange sound ahead of us in the dark."/>

In the dim light of our flashlight it seemed at first to be the floor of the pit however staring down for some time revealed moments of movement, revealing the unfathomable conclusion that whatever this was we were only seeing a portion of it, the rest being buried beneath the eons ancient rock, exposed by some seismic activity that father confirmed as he whispered “It’s just as I thought, the same quakes that created the unexpected chamber which claimed the miners must have unearthed this as well”.

We could see that the cave, which we stood in, was in danger of collapse.  Before we could react several boils appeared on the surface of the thing rising up then bursting to reveal what looked like giant slug type creatures with thick slime covered bodies with clusters of writhing appendages at the top. It looked like an anemone in the location that appeared to be its head. Scores of these burst out of the host thing and began moving towards us. They were terrifyingly fast as they climbed the shear walls of the crevasse and were upon us almost instantly. The first to crest the lip of the ledge on which we stood shot out several of its appendages which wrapped quickly around Stan’s head and shoulders and pull him to itself. Then as quickly as it came it returned back into the pit with Stan. In an instant Stan was gone, this was the last I would ever see of my faithful childhood friend. My father turned to me and screamed for me to run. I stood frozen in terror as he reached into his pants pocket for that which he intentionally had concealed there. In the moment I knew that my father must have been researching the same phenomenon we were but from a different angle entirely.  He knew where we were heading and what we would find there and he was prepared to deal with it. His hand moved from his pocket to bring up a stick of dynamite. Handing me the flashlight he drew a lighter from his breast pocket, lite the fuse and screamed from me to run. This broke my catatonia and my legs began moving before my mind had made out what was happening. It seemed as in slow motion as I ran for the tunnel entrance. Moving as fast as I could, the light of my flashlight pointing wildly about the darkness of the cave. As I stumbled out of the entrance I heard a defining whip crack sound of the dynamite as it exploded. It was only seconds before the cave began to fall in on itself sending a rush of dirt and rock out after me. I ran and did not stop, driven by terror and my father’s last words. I made it almost the whole way back home before I collapsed in the dirt and darkness surrounded me. "/>

As she told me this I was struck with the horrible reality of what had happened. Tears immediately sprang from my eyes as she asked me if I had seen my father.

My mother died five years ago and with her went the last remnants of the truth of that day in my mind. That is until this morning I read in the paper that a seismic event had opened an as yet undiscovered cavern in the old abandoned mine, the same one that had claimed the miners all that time ago and launched my father into the investigation that would end in his demise. I went to the attic immediately and searched threw old boxes for what might be left of my fathers research. I found a bound leather folder in a box at the far corner of the attic and opened it. It was in fact all of the research my father had gathered since the day of the cave in at the mine. I sat in the dust through the day and pored over my father’s last contribution to the tale of the Seed Man. "/>

He had correlated these events to happenings of cave-ins and missing children in the area. It was a match, each event started with seismic activity followed by some sort of cave-in somewhere on the mountain, then promptly followed by tales of missing children. This tracked with everything Stan and I had found about the events of missing children in the area with the exception that we had found the ages of the missing children had increased over the years. The conclusion my father came to was that something was being unearthed when these seismic events took place. The rock in the area would crack and open new avenues for whatever this thing was to access the world above. My father believed it was some sort of parasite that preyed on human beings and hypothesized that it could be thousands of years old. I in turn hypothesized that somehow it was feeding on the intellect of it’s victims, gaining knowledge with each passing event allowing it to infect the minds of more developed hosts. It seemed to me that the slug like detachments of the thing were using some sort of organic poison to cause nightmares in its victims that would break down their grip on reality until it was able to call them to it. It had to start with younger minds because they were more easily stripped of their grip on reality. As it gained more knowledge it would be able to develop more complex dreamscapes which could work on more evolved minds. My father and Stan were two of the smartest people I have ever known and whatever this thing was able to absorb from them sent shivers down my spine. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="In a horror game like Call of Cthulhu the atmosphere is the greatest tool that a keeper has to create a good scary game session. Since Call of Cthulhu tends to focus more on the story being told than the heroic advancement of individual characters it is important to give the players an engaging atmosphere that they remember rather than items of power and experience for the next session. There are physical tools to provide some of this for you however there is nothing more important than giving the players a descriptive and vibrant world in which to ply their trade. An obvious addition to a gaming session is sound. Background music and possibly atmospheric background sound, like a storm, ocean waves or wind can really set the mood. Props are also a good way to give the players a feeling of attachment to the story. Newspaper clippings that are in real newsprint to hold as they read them or possibly a mocked up photograph that the players can pass around are great props that can give the players the feeling that they themselves are taking part in the story and allow them to immerse themselves into their characters."/>

            <ITEXT CH=" Sounds and physical props are great but that is only going to get you so far in a game session. Providing tension to your session is not always easy especially when you have players who are joking around and talking out of character a lot. I am not going to discus ways to solve the situations mentioned but as a keeper you should already be pretty good at getting your players back on task. One quick suggestion on bringing the tension to a group that is talking and joking out of character is to give them two quick pieces of information, the first being mundane and the second being important or being something that the characters must react to. The first piece of information can be missed but the players will notice you are talking about in game facts, the second will be perceived by virtue of getting their attention from the first. For example, the players are entering a dark room with their flashlights trained into the darkness. Someone tells a quick joke about the last time they entered a dark room in this fashion. Everyone is laughing and having a good time. The keeper suddenly says your flashlight passes over a figure crouching in the dark corner. “What” some of the players are saying, the keeper then quickly says “The figure moves out of the light and scurries across the floor to the far end of the room”. Suddenly everyone is either interested in what is happening or at least telling the rest of the group to quiet down so they can hear what is happening. This works for me most of the time and it gets everyone back on track. "/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Now that the players are back in focus on the game we can begin to build the tension of the scene. One thing that I use quite a bit is dramatic pausing. So in our example some figure has now moved out of the light and off to a deeper part of the room. Everyone is asking questions now,  “What was that”, “Was it a person”, “Which way did it go”, “What did it look like”. At this point I like to let them stew for a few moments and say nothing, then slowly bring in some subtle detail, like a sound they hear or a feeling. “You hear singing coming from the far left corner of the room, very low but audible singing”. Then hold their attention with repetition of the sound a few times, do it a few times more than you would want to normally, lulling them into a sense that the sound is the key to focus on, at this point hit them with the reveal. When you explain the reveal make sure to do so in rapid succession to give the impression of a situation unfolding quickly and instilling the urgency to make quick actions. For example if we are using the singing example come up with a little tune that you are singing over and over. Let it go over and over a bit too long, suddenly call out several actions in succession. “You feel a rush of wind coming towards you, a figure is revealed in beam of your flashlight, you see a face before you, player X is knocked to the floor!”… “what do you do”.  What I am usually looking for here is a jump scare, its always fun to have your players jump or call out when they are startled. I may be evil but if I can get one or two jump scares in a scenario I feel like I am doing a good job. The key is to lull the players into a false sense of security in knowing what is coming next by giving them repetition, singing the song over and over makes them believe the line of the song is coming again when you change it up quickly it has a startling or jarring effect. It doesn’t have to be a sound being repeated however it could be an explanation of scenery or the description of what someone is doing. As long as you lead them down a path that seems to be the focus then pull the rug out from under them and come at them with something different. The jump scare is great but you can’t use it too often or it will lose its impact."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Another technique that I use quite often is time-based tension. Setup a situation where it is clear that something will happen soon, preferably something undesired like the monster will show up, the person whose house your are breaking  into will be home soon, anything that has a negative consequence. Then create a task that takes a prescribed amount of time and ends with some skill roll. State that the task at hand will take X amount of time to complete. Then begin to make the player roll a series of luck, or some other rolls that they will begin to perceive as the roll that brings the undesired consequence. If they make all the rolls then have them make the final skill roll to complete the task, if they do they have succeeded and can move on.  If however they fail they either begin again or abandon the task. The repeated rolls will in fact bring the undesired consequence, which the players probably have figured out, and so as time goes on each roll brings more tension. A quick example would be this. “You attempt to open the mechanical safe in the cult leaders office, you can do that however it will take an hour for you to complete your task and require a successful mechanical repair roll.” “OK, we do that” “OK, 15 minutes have passed give me a party luck roll”, “passed”, “Another 15 minutes pass give me a party luck roll”, “passed, oh man this guys going to come back while we are here, hurry up and get that thing open”, “Another 15 minutes pass give me a party luck roll”, “Oh no we better make this roll, passed we have to hurry”, “Another 15 minutes pass make me another party luck roll”, “Oh no here we go, passed, thank goodness”, “make me a mechanical repair roll”, “failed, oh man lets get out of here before we get caught”.  Time based tension is great because it gets the players cheering for each other to accomplish the task and if they succeed it gives a feeling of relief and accomplishment."/>

            <ITEXT CH="My personal favorite is what I call the unknown tension. We establish that there is something in a location that is very dangerous and very stealthy. It is impossible to know if this thing is currently at the location or if it is elsewhere. Since we have no way to confirm its whereabouts we can assume that it is in the same location as the players. Now our reluctant hero’s have to investigate the abandoned warehouse full well knowing that this is the last known location of the thing. They roam from room to room expecting the worst as each door opens. At this point you have your players right where you want them. If the thing is actually here, well then we will eventually find it or it will find us. If it is not here the players don’t know so will assume that it is. Any sound, movement from a dark corner, wind blowing through will now set the players off into a frenzy of panic and if you time your reveal right you can get a good quality jump scare out of this as well. Fear of the unknown is more powerful than something you can see and evaluate. This is the basis of most Call of Cthulhu scenarios so play up the unknown and keep up the tension as much as possible.

            <ITEXT CH="Isolation is another great way to create tension in your games. It is always good to isolate the players from the rest of society and any mundane systems of help and protection. Since Call of Cthulhu deals with fantastic creatures and situations you already have a bit of isolation from society available from the beginning. The players can’t just tell others what they have seen for risk of being committed. This removes them from society and puts them on an island to themselves. It is important to continue to further isolate your players by either environment “there is a storm and the roads are out” actions “you are illegally trespassing in the old mansion so you can’t call the police” circumstance “your in the basement, the thing is in the house above you, you see someone walking down the street above through the small cellar window, but if you call out the thing will find you” location “There is no electricity or phones in this old cabin”. Whatever the case may be the more isolated the players are the more tension this will create. There are no avenues to get help and so they are on their own. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="There are many ways to create tension in a game much more than I’ve presented here but I have tried to provide a few that can be achieved easily with the game mechanics. Keeping the players tense and on their toes makes for a truly intense game session that your players will not soon forget. Remember in Call of Cthulhu the story is the important part, creating a good amount of tension will drive that story to its horrible conclusion and along the way create memorable player interactions which wont soon be forgotten. I hope these techniques are useful to Keepers, or at least entertaining to read about. I am sure that the many great Keepers of Arcane Lore have multitudes of ways to create tension and fear in their scenarios, I’d love to hear from you."/>

            <ITEXT CH="The De Beulen Huis has its first mention in a document found in Kronborg Castle dating 1067. It is stated that a man only referred to as “the flayer”, was sealed in a tomb at the location that is now known as the De Beulen Huis graveyard (Danish translation “The Executioners House”). The tomb in question sits on a small rise in the center of the graveyard. It is said that the tomb was the first structure in this desolate location and over the years other graves were created around it eventually becoming a legitimate graveyard that is no longer in use today. Unlike many graveyards in the region there is no church or religious structure near the cemetery. It sits in a remote location several miles outside of the nearest town. There is only one road which leads to the ancient burial ground and it stops at the gate. The location is surrounded by bog and thick forest and is extremely difficult to reach from any direction save the one road that leads to it. The legend says that “the flayer” was entombed alive and remains so, sealed by dark magic’s that corrupted the souls of the five men who sealed him there."/>

            <ITEXT CH="It is also said that the five men who originally entombed “the flayer” were buried at five strategic spots around the center tomb. The positions of the graves are remarked to be in the precise positions needed to create a five-pointed star with the tomb of “the flayer” in the center. They are said to stand eternal vigil so that “the flayer” could never again walk in the land of the living. Great magic is said to have been performed upon the burial of each man, a ritual that would allow the deceased to remain conscious in their grave waiting for any sign of “the flayers” return. These five were said to carry with them into their graves powerful artifacts needed to subdue the demon and reseal the tomb. It is impossible to determine the locations of these graves as most of the older graves in the cemetery are either unmarked or have no name or distinguishing coat of arms on the gravestones. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="Due to its location far outside of the closest towns limits it was an ideal place to bury the bodies of criminals who were executed or had died in prison. Most agree that this is how the cemetery got its name “The Executioners House”. Because of the tales told about the first occupant of the graveyard and the many criminals buried around the original tomb the place gained a reputation for being not only haunted, but considered a location at which one could enter hell itself. In a circumference of around 100 yards with the center being the tomb of “the flayer” are the graves of criminals of all types; generally the most grievous and heinous of crimes were attributed to them. These graves date from the early 1100s on to the 1400s. In 1448 war between Denmark and Sweden over who should be the new king after Christoffer the Third’s death broke out lasting 7 years. The war changed much of the surrounding areas and the cemetery was forgotten for a time. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="It was in this span of time, while the graveyard went unused and unnoticed; that many groups and individuals seeking dark power came to the graveyard believing it had a direct connection to the underworld. The first mention of De Beulen Huis in occult literature is an excerpt from the De Vermiis Mysteriis written in 1542 by Ludwig Prinn. The passage in question, as translated from ancient Latin, is as follows; “The Executioners House holds a key component for the suspension of a soul in eternal darkness. The dust of the flayer can be used as a catalyst along with other components to suspend an enemy’s soul for eternity in a vessel which has been anointed with a concoction created from these ingredients”.  The second mention of the cemetery comes from the Cabala of Saboth written in 1686 by an unknown author. It speaks of powerful magic preformed in the “House of the Executioner” which allowed the souls of the “Five Guardians” to be held in eternal watch, holding back the evil presence of “the flayer” from ever being loosed upon the world of men. Finally the horrible Cultes des Goules by French author Francois-Honore Balfour written in 1702 speaks of catacombs beneath the graveyard by which one could directly enter the underworld. The passage translated to English is as follows; “An extensive system of burrows exists beneath the home of the flayer which, if traversed, leads to the underworld. This is one of several entrances in the waking world.” The graveyard has also been spoken of in many less potent books about the occult and magical rituals past and present."/>

The outside perimeter is comprised entirely of normal graves of which the most recent dates 1736. The site is now considered a historical landmark and is visited frequently by those who have interest in the darker past. Many ghost stories exist regarding the cemetery as well as notable folktales about some of the residents. Considered to be one of the most potent locations in regards to dark magic, it is very likely while visiting De Beulen Huis to see individuals and groups engaged in dark rites or rituals. It is well known that no one should ever visit De Beulen Huis at night. It is also said that grounds keepers and visitors to the site have found corpses of animals used in blood sacrifices frequently at the cemetery. As many as five murders have been committed as part of dark rituals performed in the graveyard in the darkest hours of the night, three of which are confirmed by police evidence collected at the scene.  The other two murders alleged to have been committed in De Beulen Huis are more rumor than fact however there are those who emphatically believe them to be true, even if the bodies were never found once the authorities reached the site for investigation.

            <ITEXT CH="Among many tales of evil demons, witchcraft and sorcery that are prevalent in almost every location of this charnel house there are four to which special note must be made. These stories, though considered to be folklore, have the particular quality of having historical records corroborate some of the details pertaining to the persons involved and the events that ultimately lead to their final resting place in De Beulen Huis. Of course the story of “the flayer” is the most popular and oldest of these and is the story to which the graveyard takes its name. The second oldest of these tales is that of Bernt Munken a man from a village twenty miles north of De Beulen Huis who was apprehended and convicted for the deaths of over thirty children from the area. Third in line was Ellory MontePellier, a French woman who was convicted of witchcraft in the middle 12th century. It is said she was buried alive because they were unable to kill her by conventional means. Finally there is the tale of “The Lurker” which was written about in Vatican documents stating that priests were sent to the location in an attempt to cleanse the area of an evil presence. The four priests never returned to the Vatican but are credited with putting what was said to be, a creature burrowing beneath the town of Hutsbael, down. They tracked the creature to what was apparently its den beneath none other than De Beulen Huis cemetery. Historians from the Vatican have stated that many of the older archives are written in a more symbolic nature and it is difficult to perceive them in a literal manor. They did not however deny the claims written in these testimonies. "/>

Most vegetation in De Beulen Huis seems to be unable to thrive, with the exception of a specific species of birch trees and several varieties of fungus, which grow abundantly throughout the cemetery. All other vegetation is unable to grow; it could be issues with the soil in the area coupled with the near constant and oppressive foul weather of the region or as some ancient tomes suggest, the blight of evil is so strong that nothing will grow. This leaves the location with the look of constant decay and dilapidation. It is said that to stand in De Beulen Huis is to stand within hell itself."/>

The tree that grows here constantly secretes a dark red sap that looks very similar to blood, and thus the tales of the bleeding witch tree have taken hold.

This tomb whose identifying markings have long sense worn away is said to have a peculiar wailing sound which emanates from beneath it occasionally. The tomb stands eight feet tall, ten feet in width and fifteen feet in depth, most of which is covered by the accumulation of sediment, fungus and moss, leaving it to look much more like a natural mound than a tomb. The wailing sound can be heard randomly, day or night, and has a very uneasy feel to it. Researchers have said that there is most likely a natural cavern beneath the structure that may have exposed itself, through which the passage of wind creates the unearthly howling sounds. Other less traditional texts identify this, as an entrance into the underworld, most notable of these tomes is the Cultes des Goules by Francois-Honore Balfour."/>

It is also said that leaving any obstruction on the paths over night will result in the obstruction being cast aside come morning. Due to the dangers of staying the night in De Beulen Huis, there are no recorded sightings of anything moving the obstructions during the night. Geologists hypothesize that this is some kind of geothermal phenomenon, which causes no vegetation to grow in the paths, as well as creates magnetic or thermal events that cast aside anything placed on the paths."/>

They appear to be natural rock, which have been brought to the location and stood up, as the stones, which are a strange mix of granite and limestone, are not indigenous to the area. Between the stones is a clear pathway some 5 feet across which leads to a circular clearing of about a ten-foot diameter beyond the stones. Nothing will grow on the path or the circular clearing which is a near perfect circle.  The circle can be entered from the north and examined however if anything organic passes through the stones from the south heading into the circle it will immediately disappear. It is unknown where such material goes when it passes through the gate but it is said that it is transported to a parallel dimension and exists in De Beulen Huis on a different plane.

The tale goes that a man named Cornelius Bolton arrived in a village just south of the cemetery asking about a book that was reported to have come from the region. The name of the book is lost in the annals of history however the story of Mr. Bolton has stood the test of time. The book was said to be buried in the grave of a much feared and loathed wizard who was buried in De Beulen Huis after being hung for unknown crimes. The book, which was rumored to be his book of shadows, was buried with him in hopes that he and his terrible book would never again see the light of day. When Bolton heard the tale he immediately set off for the graveyard with a wagon of digging tools. The next morning he did not appear in town and the locals went out looking for him. Fearing the worst they traveled to the graveyard only to find the standing stones and no sign of Mr. Bolton. One of the search party, a Mr. Dundar Holtz walked between the stones to the circular clearing beyond and vanished from sight. The rest of the party fled in terror and the place was shunned for many years. Eventually a bold soul who does not believe in the warnings would venture through the gate never to be seen again. To this day there is no clear explanation of the phenomenon and this area is now gated so that visitors do not mistakenly enter the Bolton Gate."/>

            <ITEXT CH="Unlike many other role-playing games Call of Cthulhu tends to focus on the story being told and role-playing over character progression and combat. We have all heard that a million times I am sure but what does that really mean for the player. As a Keeper I know that the most interesting games are the ones in which the players truly become their characters and act accordingly. I get the ability to converse with a PC and have scenes that make sense as if we were watching a movie or listening to a radio drama. There are players out there who excel at this type of on your toes role-playing that provides a rich and interesting atmosphere for the scenario and keeps the other players interested while waiting for their chance to take the spotlight. It is always great to play with someone who stays in character most of the time and maybe even does accents or alters their normal voice to fit the character. That is all well and good but I would say that a larger number of role-playing game enthusiasts who have played many games for many years do not play in this manner. Which is totally understandable and acceptable, it is rare to find full blown actors and actresses out there who enjoy the theater of it and are willing to take the stage as it were. For some players it could be that they feel a bit embarrassed or shy about getting out there even though they play in a totally accepting environment. I understand that and that is what this article is all about. How can you provide good role-playing simply by building your character with flaws?"/>

            <ITEXT CH="The first thing a Call of Cthulhu player must get passed is the idea that their cherished character will live on forever gaining power and knowledge eventually to retire after a long adventuring career. That is just not going to happen. More than likely you will be dead after the first few sessions and rolling up another character trying to figure out a good tie in for your new persona. It’s OK really, just let go and hope that your investigator has a truly epic and memorable death. The most you can hope for is to go out with a bang, maybe a literal bang, and take a few bad guys with you. If the players at your table remember your characters death after a few sessions have passed, then you have achieved a truly great thing. You now live on in the hearts and minds of the players you roll next to, session after session, it brings a tear to my eye."/>

            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="So if your character is not going to live long and gain power and knowledge then what will set them apart? Well let’s take a look at many of the common characters that people build when they come to the table. Coming from other games make selecting a character a bit challenging because initially, we do not see what we are used to. There is no clear fighter, rogue, caster or healer types that help us fall into the role we would like to play. We see professions that call out to some of these roles but nothing that is as clearly defined. So what are the most popular beginning professions? I would say Private Investigator, Soldier, Doctor and Author/Journalist."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="A lot of players new to the game will start with a Private Investigator. This is actually a great choice for a new character, they are generally tough, have weapons, and have a purpose. As a Keeper it is easy to integrate a P.I. you just give them a case to solve. Even if it’s not specific to the case the other investigators are on it is easy to have them cross paths. Most people have seen the movie P.I. and know what is expected of them. It’s an easy character to build and play."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="The Soldier, much like the P.I. is tough, has weapons skills, and is generally easy to send off on a task or mission. Soldiers are a good beginner profession because they can transition into another profession with time. If there is no war to fight they are going need some kind of job so you can then mix the soldiers skills with skills from a new profession."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="The Doctor is an obvious choice if you like playing a healer. In Call of Cthulhu this will not be what you are expecting. Doctors have the ability to pass out first aid and medicine rolls but are definitely not the healing machines that are present in other game systems. You can heal during combat but in most cases you will be stabilizing others so that you can get them to a hospital. "/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="The Author or Journalist comes up as a choice for first timers I think because it is identifiable. Much like the P.I. we generally have our notions of an intellectual author who has the keen instincts to solve the case, or the hard-nosed journalist who does what it takes to get the story. Again these are a good choice for the beginner because it is pretty open as to what these characters would have interests in. It wouldn’t be unheard of for them to pack some heat and they also have the social skills to talk their way into and out of situations."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Once players are more advanced they may begin to delve into the other profession types and create even more unique professions from these. Most people don’t start off playing an Antiquarian or Professor since at first glance they may seem ill equipped to handle the rigors of an investigation. After playing the game for a while however players will find that these characters become key to the investigation as soon as an old journal written in Latin or an artifact of unknown origin is uncovered. It is clear at this point that the other investigators would have walked into certain death had the library bound researcher not found the passage that states “can only be damaged by fire”. "/>

            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Choosing your profession is the first step to making your character interesting. The way I make intriguing characters stats here. Pick the profession you would like before rolling your stats. Some keepers may have the stats rolled first so that you can pick a profession that suites your stats. I say no, pick your profession then roll stats, because this can be your first step to creating an interesting character. If you have chosen a boxer for example but have then rolled a low strength or dexterity, we suddenly find our selves with a character who has an interesting flaw. He is a fighter but isn’t that strong and relies on wearing his opponents down, or he is just not that good, his father was a fighter and he wanted to follow in his footsteps but he loses every time he steps in the ring. Suddenly we have some back-story and something identifiable about our character. This can then be redeemed as the character goes on to defeat a horrible creature and save the world. Possibly it will simply come full circle when the character is called upon to use his fighting skills and fails. He died as he lived, fighting, poorly."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Look at each of the stats you have rolled and choose a character trait that goes along with them. Is the character unusually small or large, are they very smart or not so much, have they are very high power indicating that they are firm in their resolve and are not easily shaken. Average statistics can be glossed over but when you see a stat that is above or blow average, tie that into an interesting character trait. A Professor who is not all that sharp and is constantly getting his facts wrong, a grocery clerk who is unusually fleet of foot or an author who packs a punch with her pen and her fists. These are the beginnings of interesting characters indeed, and as a player you should be proud of your strengths and weaknesses because in the end they will make a well-rounded and memorable character. "/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="We then begin to fill in our skills, we have stills that come with our profession and will make sense for the character. Our personal skills, however, is the area we can pull in some additional character traits that will make your investigator interesting. Think about what your character is interested in. It doesn’t have to be anything that is connected with your profession. Choose interests that you might have, does the doctor enjoy sailing or is an pilot, we can put points into navigate an pilot airplane which not only make the character interesting but may come in handy on an investigation. Don’t be afraid to choose art skills like painting or singing as these can come in handy in various situations and at the very least make the character interesting. "/>

            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Avoid trying to min/max your character, this is Call of Cthulhu and this type of character building makes for less interesting characters. Don’t just pick skills you think you will need but pick ones that your character would have. For example, is the musician really going to have a high First Aid and Medicine skill or did you pick that only because you know it will be useful. Making your character with the intention of winning the game is a serious detriment to making them interesting and believable. There is no winning in Call of Cthulhu there is only horror and insanity, you really need to embrace that and do it in style. Some players are inclined to that and some are not. If you don’t like knowing you will go insane or die and that your character is not going to be around for too long, well my friend, the door is over there, watch out for Deep Ones in the parking lot."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="Finally we round the character out with personal details. You probably picked an age earlier since it effects your education among other things. Pick an age that makes sense, don’t just go for a younger character because you want to be spry and sexy. Talk with your Keeper on where your character should be from. Normally it will be no problem however if you are from China and the game is set in Boston it can cause extra game time working your character into the plot instead of time spent playing the scenario. "/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="We finalize the character with back-story. Now, it is tempting to come up with an elaborate back-story for the character, but take a step back, You will be playing this character and gaining back-story as you go, so you don’t need an entire novel to being with. Also make sure you are not stepping on any of the Keepers plot threads with your back-story. Under no circumstance should you have a mythos related back-story. It makes it harder for the Keeper to introduce the sanity shattering horrors of the Mythos when your character is like, “um yeah my professor has seen these things before, see he was attacked as a kid and bla bla bla,” thanks you just made this really cool reveal less impactful for the rest of the players. Have your back story shape your character but not prop them up. For example, you almost drown as a child and so you dislike deep water, not “I was bitten by a radioactive spider and now I climb walls.” Don’t be too elaborate unless you want your Keeper to forget everything you have come up with and never use your back-story in the game. Keepers have enough to think about without worrying about how your Aunt Beth lives in Michigan and makes great pies, which the Keeper should obviously know because it is on page ninety-six of your characters back-story."/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <para ALIGN="3"/>
            <ITEXT CH="In the end make a character that is a believable person with strengths and flaws. You will be playing in a world that is full of the bizarre and fantastic and you will have plenty of chances to add that into your back-story as you play. How a person deals with and reacts to the insane world of Cthulhu Mythos is all part of the fun so try to experience it, not aim to defeat or rise above it. Play your character with flaws, do stuff you think your character would do, slip, fall, run away and scream. I promise you will have a good time and you will create a good time for the other players at your table.  Cthulhu Fhtagn."/>

I have given my best efforts to every client and case file that has come across my desk and I have done so happily and with out any complaints. I came to the firm after graduating head of my class and with many recommendations from professors and firms, which I had interned for during my years as a student. Billings and Lafayette hired me under advisement from several noteworthy sources and I have been told many times that I am in line to be made full partner. I tell you this not to prop myself up but to assure whom ever reads this that I do not put forth this assessment due to dissatisfaction with the firm or my employment within it. This is not the rantings of a disgruntled or abused man wanting to disparage the good name of Billings and Lafayette. No, I write this as a warning, to the one who will come after me. Do not dig deeper, do not read the journals, do not go to that cursed house. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="I found this file waiting for me on my desk, just four days ago, February 13th 1922. I saw clients name and, from research I had done prior to taking my position with the firm, knew it to be the first and most fortuitous acquisitions the firm held. In fact the money paid to handle this estate opened the doors of Billings and Lafayette and has kept them open for many years. The McGinley estate was taken on by the firm with an initial fee that far exceeded any other of it’s kind for it’s time, even today the sum initially put forward would be considered extravagant to say the least. From my initial research it was clear that Mr. Stewart Billings and Mr. Bernard Lafayette were college friends of Mr. Colton McGinley and it was perceived that it was this friendship that prompted such an exorbitant initial infusion of capital into what was yet to be a law firm. Nevertheless, the McGinley estate became the first in a long line of real estate and financial holdings the firm would base its practice on and be the foundation of which the firm would stand. Knowing how important this particular client was, it was of the utmost importance that I handle this estate with care and expertise."/>

            <ITEXT CH="Before delving too deeply into the files I thought I would do a bit of research on the men who began this all those years ago. I knew that Billings, Lafayette and McGinley were old school chums and so I decided to start there. All three attended Harvard University and it was not at all difficult to find information in the schools archives to corroborate their friendship. They graduated in 1852, Billings and Lafayette in law and McGinley in history. I found it interesting to note that two other men were frequently mentioned and featured in photographs, a Mr. Wesley Lawton a student of medicine and a Mr. Abram Penkin a student of philosophy. I was able to divulge from old year book photos, student newspaper articles and the local papers from the time that the group of men were part of a club of sorts which was documented in the schools archives and from all accounts the men were inseparable. It was three weeks after graduation that an indecent involving Mr. Lawton and Mr. Penkin would break apart the group and prompt Mr. McGinley to offer a large sum of money to the two law students to handle his estate. Lawton and Penkin both were lost in an accident while spelunking caverns in northern Massachusetts, buried alive with no hope of rescue. The other three men who were with them gave statements that a cave-in had separated the two men from the others and they were presumed to be dead."/>

            <ITEXT CH="This event took its toll on the three men. McGinley became reclusive and guarded, spending most of his time in the large house that he purchased before graduation. Located several miles outside of Boston, nestled in the forests of rural Massachusetts, this large three-story dwelling was his last connection to the group of friends that he cherished so dearly before the accident. McGinley was the only son of a prominent manufacturing tycoon who had died before his last year at Harvard, leaving the business and all the family holdings to Mr. McGinley. After setting up the estate with Billings and Lafayette very little was done with the family assets for some time. After what would appear to be a grieving period Mr. McGinley began to take more of an active roll in the family business and began taking many trips abroad, presumably striking new partnerships overseas. After some years, McGinley married and fathered two sons, Charles and Christopher. It seemed as though the sadness that had consumed him after the deaths of his friends was finally lifted. He moved his wife and two children into the house outside of Boston. With the business doing well they lived without incident for some time. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="During the winter of 1864 an unfortunate accident took the life of Mr. McGinley’s wife, Bethany. She was found at the foot of the basement stairs with her neck broken. The police report states that she slipped on a frozen step while going down into the basement early in the morning. It was her husband who found her after coming down to breakfast and noticing the basement door ajar. Mr. McGinley told police that the basement stairs freeze on cold nights because of improperly sealed windows that he grieved over not having had time to fix. The death was deemed accidental and the funeral services were handled a week after. Mr. McGinley hired a small staff to take care of the house and the two children ages two and four. It was noted in various journals and found within the estate documents that McGinley became an almost complete recluse at this point, spending most of his time locked in his study or taking trips abroad for what appeared to be no reasonable goal. Several newspaper articles from this period speak of the unease from the investors of the company, as the figurehead seemed to be in a downward spiral. "/>

The boy was reported missing on a Sunday when he did not come in for lunch; he had been playing in the fields behind the home and did not return with his brother when the boys were called in. Mr. McGinley was frantic and immediately put together a search party. The local police advised McGinley to wait and see if the boy would turn up, but he would not be dissuaded and a search party was formed. The offer of a five thousand dollar reward was put up and the locals were stirred into a frenzy looking for the boy. After an exhaustive search a hole in the ground was found some distance behind the house, which was mostly covered in leaves and branches. When investigated it was found that the hole opened up into an old dry well that had been buried for years. The spring rains must have uncovered the well and after noticing an odor coming from the within the search party uncovered the rest of the well and found the young boys body broken and twisted fifty feet down at the bottom."/>

Strangely enough it did not seem to create a closer bond with the older boy, on the contrary it only served to have them drift further apart. In 1878, the oldest son Christopher, left the home for college at the nearby Miskatonic University. It was a year later in 1879 that Colton McGinley, standing in front of the large bay window at the front of the house, with the curtains open for all to see, used his thirty eight caliber revolver to take his own life."/>

            <ITEXT CH="I was taken aback by the amount of tragedy that had befallen the McGinley family over the years since Colton McGinley inherited the family estate, but in my years at Billings and Lafayette I had seen much tragedy and loss in the cases I worked on. After a thorough examination of the estate’s holdings, assets and stipulations I was ready to take action on the transition of the estate to the new beneficiary. There was nothing out of the ordinary in the documentation with the exception of two stipulations that were listed as the most stringent of the requests. The first, which did not strike me as odd, knowing the tragic tale of Mr. McGinley’s college friends, was the order of inheritance. The estate would be passed on to the last surviving and capable dependent of the McGinley family. If there were no surviving descendants the estate and all holdings and assets would be transferred to the last surviving and capable descendants of Wesley Lawton, and if none could be found in the Lawton line all would pass on to the descendants of Abram Penkin. If no surviving person could claim the inheritance, the entire estate would be liquidated and donated to the Miskatonic University. I found it strange that the money should go to the small mystery shrouded school in Arkham; instead of McGinley’s Alma matter Harvard. The other stipulation, which was, worded so strongly that it made me take pause. The house outside of Boston at 1747 Waverley Oaks Road in Waltham, the house at which all of the families tragedy had taken place, the very house were Colton McGinley took his own life, was never to be sold or torn down. It was so emphatically stated that the house must never be sold outside of the three families who would be beneficiaries of the estate and even then was never to be torn down or otherwise demolished except of its own decay over the years. This stipulation was the one worry I had in being the executor of this estate, I was worried that it would be difficult to keep whom ever was to take it over from simply selling or tearing down the house to rebuild on the property."/>

            <ITEXT CH="I made arrangements to hire an accountant to look through the businesses books and take a look at the families assets to determine what could be sold off and what could be salvaged. The companies ledgers were sent to my office along with several other boxes of paperwork accumulated over the years, the sum of which invaded nearly half of the space provided by my cramped corner office. I hired an old friend, Stanley Brooks, who I knew from school and who I had worked with several times in the past. Stanley was a no nonsense type of man with a strong work ethic and a keen attention to detail. I felt comfortable that Mr. Brooks would make the correct recommendations and afford the best return on the estates investments. He was to meet me at my office the next morning to begin to wade threw the sea of disorganized paper work that had been dropped off earlier in the day. I also took the liberty of acquiring the services of a Ms. Agnes Waterford, a local antiquarian whose eye for expensive antiques and amassed knowledge of local history were unmatched. She would be invaluable in appraising the various items that would no doubt be uncovered once we evaluated the McGinley home. With all of that squared away I settled in for a long night of research into the family line, to find a surviving descendant."/>

            <ITEXT CH="I worked into night accompanied only by the ticking of my wall clock and the glow of the street lamp outside my office window. It seemed that the tragedy that befell the McGinley family did not end with the death of Colton McGinley. His son Christopher, after graduating with masters in linguistics, went abroad for the following four years. It was within the estate records where I found traces of his adventures. Transfers of money into foreign bank accounts, passage on ships and trains throughout Europe and the African continent. Christopher returned to the states in 1888 and it seemed a transformation had taken place. He began taking an active hand in the family business and for the first time in many years it began to make more than it was losing. Two years later in 1890 he was married to a Ms. Claudette Morrow. Their first born, a daughter, Agatha McGinley was born in 1892 and a son Peter in 1894, it looked as though the family was shrugging off the weight of their rocky past. Things changed in 1896 when it is recorded in the estates file that Claudette McGinley requested the key to a safe deposit box that Christopher’s father had acquired at the bank. The contents of the safe deposit box were not recorded anywhere in the files and there only remained a key and a number within the estates records. "/>

Her body was found in front of the large bay window that fronts the house. Mr. McGinley was away at the time of the accident, traveling for business purposes in Russia. The McGinley’s four-year-old daughter Agatha was found walking down the road holding her two year old brother and murmuring about a beast, which had thrown her mother from the window. The house was thoroughly searched and nothing could be found that resembled the young girls ramblings. The description in the police report, which I found later, was as such. Agatha described a large creature that had to stoop down to fit in the confines of the house, it had dark green skin which glistened as if covered with some sort of mucus or slime. She saw it from behind and so did not get a look at the face of the thing but noted that it walked on two legs and had multiple appendages coming off the torso, which she took for arms. These arms however did not appear to be jointed as she described them as waving like hair in the wind. The thing had her mother tangled in its multiple appendages and was pulling her close to its body. She described a loud sucking sound and finally the sound of something ripping open. After that she stated that the thing flung her mother out the window and she had ran before it could turn to see her behind it. She grabbed the baby and ran from the house. Needless to say Agatha was institutionalized after this incident and a trust was formed as part of the estate to pay for her continued care. I noted that Agatha was still alive and jotted down the location of the hospital so that I could visit her and establish if she was in a good enough mental state to receive the inheritance. "/>

He hired on some staff to help him with the day-to-day management of the house and the care of the two year old Peter. Again the pattern emerged of unsubstantiated trips to various exotic locals. Among the notable locations which both his father, and now Christopher visited, included  Egypt, Italian North Africa, various locations in Central and South America, and Russia. In 1913 his son Peter left the home for college at the Miskatonic University, which his father also attended. During Peter’s sophomore year, after returning home from Arkhangelisk Russia, Christopher McGinley added a sealed letter to the estates documents, which is oddly enough missing from the current file, returned the safe deposit box key, and proceeded to hang himself. Mr. McGinley’s corpse was found hanging, prominently displayed in the large bay window, which dominates the front of the home, two days later."/>

As his father before him he requested the key to the safe deposit box and was not seen or heard from for the next two months. He resurfaced after two months and came again to the firm, he added a folded note to the estate’s documents, returned the key, and hung himself in the exact spot which his father had eight years prior.

I woke in the morning to the sound of Mrs. Lampton opening up the office and getting things ready for the start of the business day. As prompt as ever Mr. Brooks entered my office at the exact agreed upon time and with a slightly disguised sigh, began to dig through the unorganized pile of paperwork provided by McGinley Manufacturing Inc.

Ms. Waterford and I were escorted to a private room in which to unlock the twelve by twelve inch metal box containing the treasured possessions of the McGinley family. To our surprise there were only three items in the box. A thin leather bound journal which seemed old but unremarkable, a key which looked old as well, and finally a smooth white stone with a symbol carved into it. The stone was the size of a fist, smooth and stark white. Chiseled onto one side and filled with some type of dark ink was the symbol, a oddly asymmetric five pointed star with a flaming eye in its center. The symbol looked like the pentacles depicted on various pagan artifacts and my initial thought was that this might have been some sort of religions relic that held some value. Ms. Waterford could not afford any deeper information about the stone but dated the key and journal at around seventy or more years old. The journal contained mostly illegible text, which seemed to be in many different languages. The only legible text appeared on the first page, it was written in the same hand as the rest of the book but this was in English and was short but coherent. "/>

At any rate it had no bearing on the estates finances or assets and I shrugged it off as a footnote in the strange story of the McGinley estate. Ms. Waterford seemed interested in the strange stone and so I gave it to her for further study, she could not make anything of the book but did verify its age and apparent authenticity. I arranged to have Ms. Waterford meet me at the home on Waverley Oaks road the next day and bid her goodbye. Before returning to the office I wanted to take the opportunity to research the family lines of Lawton and Penkin. Lawton would be the next in line for inheritance if Agatha McGinley was not of sound mind and I thought it prudent to find the descendant of the Penkin family as well, in case there was trouble transferring the estate to the Lawton’s."/>

The middle son, Sergei Penkin survived the fire and was a key witness in the murder trial of Langford Potts who was convicted of setting the fire that killed the family based on the testimony of Sergei. Mr. Potts last words after the sentencing were “I put them down in the name of God, my only failure is that I didn’t get them all”. Sergei Penkin married and had a son and daughter. The only living descendant of the Penkin line is Maxim Penkin. Maxim Penkin was the sole survivor of the family after his father murdered the mother and daughter with a wood axe before taking his own life with a double-barreled shotgun in the barn.  Martin was found in the house hiding, which saved his life. He has spent several years in a sanitarium after and then lived in a Boston orphanage until he was of age.

Mr. Gerald Lawton answered the phone and I explained to him the circumstances that had transpired to facilitate the transfer of the McGinley estate to the Lawton family. Mr. Lawton did not know any of the history connected with the McGinley family but he was aware of the tragic cave-in that claimed the life of his great grand uncle. The Lawton’s had not maintained any connection to the other families involved in the odd history of the estate, and I saw no reason to convey some of the unsavory facts of the parties involved. I setup a time to meet at the property in Waltham and Mr. Lawton agreed to the meeting. He seemed excited about the inheritance and the idea of acquiring the property.

I sat at my desk staring at the contents of the safe deposit box which I had laid out on the desk in front of me. The key, which could not be for the doors since I had a set of keys for the property, none of which were similar to this one in age or style. The journal, which was completely illegible and so, could not be studied to extract its contents. I thought that I might show it to Mr. Brooks to see what he could make of it. There were some pages which had what seemed to be mathematical formulas and so being a man of numbers maybe he could glean something from its pages.

The house looked to be in decent shape from the outside if a bit overgrown where the landscaping was concerned. It would probably need a fresh coat of paint but there didn’t appear to be any major structural damage. I climbed the four wooden steps onto the porch and tried the key in the front door. The key easily slid into the lock and turned without protest. As I entered the home I had the slightest bit of anticipation of some horrible scene that would be displayed before me. When the door opened on the mundane quiet abode, I smiled slightly, thinking myself silly for falling prey to the macabre stories of the house. It was a house like any other, unfortunate events had transpired here, but this could be said of many old houses. I walked into the foyer and then on into the main house. The place was kept tidy if a bit dust for the last few weeks of disuse. The furniture was sparse but well maintained and things appeared to be in order. I turned to the right and on into the great room of the house and there paused for a moment as I gazed upon the often mentioned large bay window which was the focal point of so many of the tragic endings this house bared witness to. Against my irrational desire to avoid this portion of the house, I stepped slowly to the window and drew back the curtains so that I could let more light in. I believed at the time that there must have been some subconscious reaction to the cursed and sinister window but indeed my stomach turned, as I got close enough to draw back the window treatments. I also felt a slight dizziness and a dryness of mouth, which I could not explain. Thinking myself silly for engaging in such flights of fancy, I quickly moved through the rest of the house. Opening the curtains and shades so that the house had a bright cheery quality to it. As I went back out of the front door to get some paperwork from my auto I glanced above the door way and there, carved perfectly and almost decoratively in the wooden framing was the same symbol that appeared on the strange rock Ms. Waterford had been so interested in. I then began to believe that it must be some sort of family crest or religious symbol that I was not familiar with. In any case it was carved into the wood with obvious care and was a nice conversation piece. "/>

Mr. Lawton was impressed by the size of the home and could not believe his fortune at having unexpectedly been attached to this inheritance. He brought with him his architect friend and a contractor as promised. The architect, a Mr. Carl Stark was impressed by the condition of the home and was conveying to Mr. Lawton how fortunate he was that the home had not fallen into disrepair, while the contractor Mr. Nathanial Elliot began to take measurements and inspect the home. Ms. Waterford got right to work cataloging the various pieces of furniture and the other items in the house. After an hour of this, Ms. Waterford called me into the master bedroom upstairs, insisting that I must see something, which she had found there. When I entered the room she was standing to the left side of a large canopy bed just before the heating register. I asked what was so exciting and without answering she crouched down and reached a finger into the heating grate. I could see her fiddle with something inside the duct that hung down from above just barely noticeable if one were to crouch down and look in. She pulled back on the small lever and with a quiet click a two-foot by two-foot section of the wall opened slightly, the seam of which was so cleverly disguised in the wood paneling that it would never have been noticed. Amazed I went to the wall and pulled the door the rest of the way open. Beyond the door was another flat metal door with a small handle and a keyhole. I was excited to see the keyhole as I had tried the strange old key that we found in the safe deposit box everywhere throughout the house to no avail. I cautiously inserted the key into the hole and turned it. I almost called out with excitement as I heard the audible click of the tumblers and pulling the handle the door easily opened. At that moment a loud crash as if something large had crashed into the side of the house cause both Ms. Waterford and I to call out in shock. Just before I rushed out of the room and downstairs to see what caused the cacophony, I spied beyond the small curiously hidden door what looked to be three small books or journals. I left Agnes to the books and rushed downstairs."/>

Hurried out the front door and to the left around the north side of the house. To my utter amazement when I rounded the corner it was unquestionably apparent what had caused the horrible crash. An old elm tree had fallen onto the side of the house. Luckily it was close enough to the house that the fall did not allow the bulk of the tree to pick up momentum as if fell. It didn’t seem to have done any major structural damage, only cosmetic and one of the upstairs windows had been broken. Mr. Elliot was examining the tree when I reached it and I asked his opinion on the situation. In his assessment it was strange that the tree had fallen since it appeared healthy however he believed that it may have been a shifting of the sediment that caused the root system to dislodge and allow the weight of the tree to topple it. It was plain to see that the earth around the base of the tree was significantly disturbed."/>

He was a student at Harvard and couldn’t be expected to maintain a company of that size so it was understandable, however Mr. Brooks noted that it was more from disinterest and flamboyant spending of his own than any sort of mismanagement. The house which I had just left being the first major purchase that the young McGinley had made and that was not the end of it. Apparently there were several trips abroad for himself and a Mr. Penkin in which extravagant accommodations and the procurement of guides for excursions into uncharted regions had been frequent. There was even a large sum paid out for excavating equipment in some remote region of Denmark. It was unclear what this excavation was for or what the result had been. He also noted that Colton’s son had not done much better though he for a time kept the company afloat but then as his father before him descended into exorbitant spending on travel and soliciting the services of certain experts in history, anthropology, mythology, folklore and even physics. None of which had ever produced any gains for the company or the family. It seems as though these were just personal interests that the men were feeding money into.

            <ITEXT CH="As I suspected, the first journal was that of Colton McGinley. The entries began in 1849 in his fourth year at Harvard. Initially the entries were fairly mundane and typical for a student describing day to day live at university. In September that year Mr. McGinley met Abram Penkin and it seemed that the two became fast friends. Both men had an interest in the idea held in some occult circles that one could travel alternate dimensions than our own or look into the future or past by use of magical principals and techniques. In the beginning it seemed to be a flight of fancy for both men, some strange and exciting phenomenon, which they discussed and theorized about but at that point, did not believe to be achievable. They began researching the occult in earnest, as well as other broader topics in physics and mathematics. It seemed innocent at first, just a young mans wild speculations. It was not until they returned to school after summer holiday in 1850 that things took a dramatic turn. Colton’s father had died and left the entirety of the family fortune and business to him. He had never had a strong relationship with his father and so was not grieving for long before getting to back into the swing of day-to-day life at Harvard. It was during the first semester that Mr. Penkin came to McGinley with some rather exciting news. Penkin had spent the summer researching various occult volumes, focusing on dimensional travel and had found a specific mention of a book entitled Cabala of Saboth written in 1686 by an unknown author. He had spent a significant amount of time trying to locate a copy of the text and finally found a copy, which was in the restricted section of the Oren Library at the Miskatonic University. Penkin had managed to convince the head librarian to allow him to view the accursed book, and had taken down some information, which he believed was the break they had been looking for in uncovering the mysteries of the universe. The book hinted at some malevolent entity worshiped by witches and sorcerers who could grant its supplicants, through certain rituals, passage through dimensional rifts referred to as gates by the author. One such sorcerer was Maxim Utkin, who as the story told, had perfected rituals or spells which could in fact allow him to travel through dimensions and even time itself. It was said that his powerful grimoire was buried with him in an infamous graveyard in Denmark, De Beulen Huis, roughly translated from it’s native Danish as “The Executioners House”."/>

Utkin was a bit of a legendary figure in Russian mythology according to Penkin who was himself Russian. The stories say that he was over two hundred years old and was the object of many tales told to children who did not behave. Penkin remembered his grandmother telling him stories of the evil sorcerer Utkin who would come for children who did not obey their elders. According to some of the research the men had done Utkin was a real man who was buried with, as the stories called it, his evil book, in De Beulen Huis cemetery. It was during winter break that year that the two young men traveled to Denmark in search of their prize. Indeed they found De Beulen Huis and indeed they found the grave of the foul Mr. Utkin. They managed to extract the book from its vile resting place and returned home as winter session began again. "/>

It was at this time the Penkin began a transformation that was not for the better. He became more withdrawn and paranoid. He would lock himself away with the book for days on end working into the night with reckless disregard for his own health.

It did not take long however for McGinley to fall back into his old ways, asking the two law students if they had any interest in the occult or the unexplained. Much to his surprise both men had an interest for the bizarre and fantastic. He then began a slow process of introducing the men to some of the things that Penkin and he had discovered.

Deeper they went into the shadowed realms in an effort to understand and hone their craft. At this point they began referring to their group as Tenebris Circuli, latin for the dark circle. When school renewed they were in full swing, reveling in the idea that they were going to discover mysteries of the unknown that their peers could not fathom. Mr. Wesley Lawton, a student of medicine and a dyed in the wool skeptic, then approached them. He challenged all of their claims and demanded proof. This endeared Mr. Lawton to the group, they agreed that a skeptic would keep them balanced, and keep them from seeing success where there was none. It didn’t take much time for Lawton to become a full member of Tenebris Circuli and a integral piece for the group. "/>

To keep it safe, he said, he had written the translation in a code, which required a key to decode. He was concerned that others may try to obtain their work and take credit for the discoveries they were so close to obtaining. He gave the key portion to Mr. McGinley and kept the encoded portion for himself. McGinley notes at this time, a marked change in Penkin. Something behind the eyes, a colder tone and humorless presence. It was as if the old Penkin was gone, replaced by a cold and calculating doppelganger whose only drive was to unlock the mysteries of that book. "/>

Penkin was ecstatic about the discovery and wanted to attempt the ritual straight away. It was a few weeks after graduation and the group was to congregate at the house outside of Boston to attempt to send Mr. Penkin through a gate and into another dimension.

From all accounts the ritual was a complete success, a gate was drawn on the floor in the great room of the house, the proper incantations and rituals were preformed, and finally Mr. Penkin stepped into the circular symbol they had created as the gate. If the journal is to be believed he then vanished. The other men were astonished and could not believe what they had seen. The remaining men stood before the gate gazing in wonder, but then, the abomination crossed back over the threshold. The thing that came back through the gate was not Abram Penkin though it bore his face. It was a figure standing on two legs, which were bent in awkward places and from its torso extended several writhing pseudo-pods that undulated with some sort of unheard rhythm. The skin of the thing was dark and wet with some sort of mucus which constantly ran down the thing. Atop that blasphemous torso was the visage of their friend Penkin but bloated with puss filled tumors bulging from random locations around the head. It turned to the three men who could only stare frozen in fear and exhibited what McGinley described as a victorious smile. "/>

McGinley had prepared for trouble and had created a single silver disc baring the symbol of a five pointed star emblazoned with a flaming eye in its center. He rushed to the thing pressing the disk to its skin; it dropped the limp form of Lawton to the ground and shrank back staring wildly at McGinley. He called for Lafayette to bring something to bind the foul beast with and Lafayette rushed off, returning with a length of rope, which, they hastily tied around the abomination. With the symbol subduing the thing they quickly secured a chain that was used to secure the outside basement doors and bound the thing with it affixing the disk to the chain. Then dragged the thing and Mr. Lawton’s body down into the basement. On through the night, until morning they worked at bricking the thing and Lawton’s corpse into the center wall of the basement. All the while they worked the thing stared at them and made no sound. Once finished they carved the symbol on the freshly made brick wall and set about carving the same symbol into each of the entry ways and windows of the home.

They told there tale to authorities and the families and an investigation was never pursued. The guilt at what they had done was almost too much to bare. Mr. McGinley, fearing the others would eventually crack and reveal the truth of that ill-fated weekend, approached Billings and Lafayette with the idea of them handling his estate. He gave them a large sum of money upfront that he told them could be seed money for a practice of their own. The two lawyers could not pass up such an opportunity. They could open a firm before either had even passed the Barr, or begin with such a large estate in hand that they would not be struggling for clients within the early years. Billings and Lafayette was created with blood money given to them by Colton McGinley with the express purpose of keeping the horrible secrete they had walled into the basement of the house on Waverley Oaks road.

He remembered the horrible dreams he had there and the tragic death of his mother. After graduation he took time to travel abroad, and returned to the states with a renewed energy and a desire to put the family back on course. He began to take a hand in the company, which was slowly falling, to ruin from neglect and managed to pull it up from its downward spiral.

            <ITEXT CH="It was then that the tree outside shifted again causing a breakage in the north wall where Mr. Elliot was working. This in turn caused some cracking of the bricks on the east wall and much to the horror of everyone in the room a portion of the eastern wall fell away to reveal what none of use could believe. In the dark recess of the exposed section of brick we saw what looked to be the face of a man. A horrible stench came from inside and Mr. Elliot being the closest gaged as the noxious odor. Ms. Waterford was exclaiming that we should not go near it as Elliot stepped closer to the thing in the wall. We could see it was a human face though it had strange deformities on either side, which looked like large tumors or growths. Before I could move to turn Mr. Elliot away form the thing we were all struck by a feeling of heinous dread and fear as the thing in the wall opened its eyes. Elliot bellowed out a curse as Ms. Waterford covered her eyes in shock and terror. I sprang into action with fear coursing through my veins, I moved toward Elliot to pull him away from the thing but I was a moment too late. Several sickly slender and writhing appendages squirmed out from the broken section of wall and wrapped themselves around the unsuspecting contractor. It pulled him quickly into the open section of wall, which obscured the grotesque face that lurked within. I could hear a sickly sucking sound as Mr. Elliots legs began to shake and kick wildly. Waterford screamed but even so moved past me with a revolver in her hand. In a moment the thing released Mr. Elliot and his lifeless body crumpled to the floor. Ms. Waterford fired all five of her rounds into the thing but it seemed to have no effect, it only stared at us with an evil malignant calm that spoke of unearthly patience. It was then that Mr. Stark scrambled down the stairs holding a mud-smeared book in one hand and a large hunting knife in the other."/>

Stark rolled off of her and I could see the large knife protruding from Ms. Waterford’s chest, she was not moving and I could see her lifeless eyes as she stared vacantly in my direction. Stark then stood and moved toward the opening of the wall and began pulling bricks from it widening the breach. I moved quickly to my feet pulling the knife from the lifeless body of Ms. Waterford and drove it into the back of Mr. Stark.

            <ITEXT CH="I am often asked during character creation or game play, what would anyone ever use the accounting skill for? Most people see accounting as something that would have no place in a fantastic world filled with eldritch horrors and lurking cultists. It makes one wonder why the creators of the Call of Cthulhu system would have the skill featured prominently on the character sheet for all to amaze and wonder. Well have no fear keepers and players alike, I am about to put forth some uses for this skill that will not only be handy but could provide the pivotal clue that will unlock the doors to terrible Mythos threat that lies beneath every good Call of Cthulhu scenario."/>

Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. Well if you haven’t fallen asleep yet I applaud you, but what does this mean in the world of CoC. Well it means you can play a character that everyone underestimates and when the time is right unleash your unbridled accounting fury. Or you can spend the night digging into the books of that company, owned by the cult leader, that you just know is trafficking mythos items. Kidding aside your accounting skills can come in handy in many situations, it just takes a bit of creative thinking."/>

Lets say your group is trying to find the house where a person of interest might be keeping their next victim. Well let’s take a look into the man’s finances for a bit and see where he’s been spending his money. Ah we found that he has made some purchases on the south side, and looking into the records of his parents we find that they owned a house in that neighborhood. It’s a good bet that is the house he is using to hide his victims. Now you can send in the gun-wielding folks to do the dirty work. See you may be lifted onto the shoulders of your teammates with the crowd going wild yet."/>

You can go shake down cultist after cultist, but you know they can be pretty tight lipped and lets face it, the god they worship will do much worse to than you ever could. How about let the accountant take crack at it, a few hours with the bank account and voila, we see that the book was purchased at Stanford’s Rare Books and Curiosities. Now it’s a quick trip to Sanford’s to see if he remembers the person who bought it. Maybe he has an address on file or a phone number."/>

At the risk of hearing him gloat about how another case was cracked by the bean counter, you need to have him take a look at the funeral parlors books. Here we are, the place doesn’t seem to have purchased any embalming fluid in months, strange, and the cost of operating and maintaining a crematorium are not listed either.

The numbers don’t lie, and you can easily build a case for the police based on facts and figures. Being that math is the universal language, books in different languages do not necessarily stymie the accountant, if there are numbers to be worked, the language makes no difference."/>

            <ITEXT CH="As a keeper, I am constantly molding the plot clay while the game is going. I tend to want the players to succeed, which I don’t believe is an uncommon keeping style, but I also don’t want them to walk through as if nothing can touch them. I enjoy the frailty of the Call of Cthulhu investigator. It gives a real sense of danger and excitement that I think lacks in other systems. At the same time it can really piss the players off when they are killed one turn into the first real action in the game. Success does not always mean death though, it can also mean stopping the big bad or saving the sacrificial victim or a whole host of other outcomes. Success to me also means moving the plot forward, finding the clues that get the investigators to the next scene. Nothing kills the mood more than the players sitting around trying to come up with a plan when they are not really sure what the hell they should be doing. Incoming idea rolls… boring."/>

            <ITEXT CH="I have also mistakenly tried to guide the players in the right direction, sometimes by force and sometimes with a gentle hand. Dropping hints, in NPC dialog is always a good way to go however sometimes if the jokes are flying the players will miss a clue that is too subtle. A simple slip of the NPCs tongue can be great if everyone is engaged but if you drop important clues that way it can end up being lost. Wait, Mr. Collins said what? Now no one understands this clue path that is so obvious in your mind that you begin getting frustrated. Your big reveal is going to get lost on everyone. Having an NPC offer help or push the players in a direction is a way to go as well, but this is fraught with danger. You can end up getting someone killed and now your fabulous NPC who the investigators are supposed to form tight bonds with is just, that asshole who’s plan got Carl Cant-sneak killed.  Anyone who has attempted to endear Jackson Elias to his or her investigators as poorly as I did will understand the pain I’m talking about. Sometimes trying to get the players on track can be the worst thing for them. Sometimes you just have to let go and let the game take you where it wants to go."/>

            <para/>
            <ITEXT CH="Learning to let go is not easy but it can be the best experience you will ever have at the gaming table. I still find myself unable to take my own advice but when I eventually step back and just let things happen, the game begins to flow again. The first important thing to understand is time. If you are doing a one shot or a tournament style game you don’t have the time to let the players talk about the wallpaper or how wonderful the wine is. You can’t just say, “hey get back on topic we only have an hour left” because that would really spoil the mood, at the same time you can’t let the investigators run off to some other town on a misguided hunch. I good tool here is game time, or some jarring event. With game time you can set a perceived cut off time, it doesn’t even have to be legitimate but if you have the players thinking they only have till midnight to solve the case, they wont be driving out to visit the grandma of the butler of the friend of the NPC who actually matters. This also gives you a exit strategy if the game goes long. If there are five minutes left to play and the investigators have not made any headway, you can have that clock strike midnight and the malevolent horror devour the world. The other technique is a jarring event, nothing gets things back on track like a horrifying monster showing up to eat some tasty investigators. Nothing brings the investigators together like the threat of certain death. Dropping a few clues into the event will get the players laser focused on the task at hand, now that they’ve had a little mortality gut check. This should give them the feeling that they really need to solve this thing before anything else comes back hungry. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="These are fine ways to get players back on track but we are here to go off the rails as it were. Sometimes the only solution is the let go. Forget about the plot at hand and just let them head in whichever direction blows their hair back. If they are not following the plot, that’s fine, they will either solve the case or die horribly, either way everyone will have a good time because you will not be forcing them into situations they had not come up with organically. Let them sit and have an hour-long conversation between themselves. That’s fine as long as they are having fun with the role-playing. Let them slog off to god knows were in search of some distant relative that has nothing to do with the plot. It’s fine; you may even come up with a totally different plot in the process. It is more about having fun than it is about sticking to the letter of the scenario. So let go, and chances are the players will reign themselves in. "/>

            <ITEXT CH="Try not to railroad your players into doing the investigation you think they should do. Let them sink or swim. I have railroaded players enough to know that it generally doesn’t turn out the way you thought it would anyhow. Inevitably your players will hate the NPC you want them to love, love the NPC you want them to hate, go left when they should go right and use dynamite where a simple conversation could suffice. Remember it is their story too, you are not the only storyteller and you should let your players enjoy creating a vibrant world in which to play in."/>

            <para/>
            <ITEXT CH="Now for the disclaimer, it is not always appropriate to let the players go off and create their own story in the middle of the scenario. There are limits to what the players should be able to dictate and what you as a keeper must keep consistent. If a player wants to do something that completely derails the game and ruins the fun for everyone else then you as the keeper need to put an quick end to it. If there is something that is feasible but would end up burning the time you have to play, it could be a good idea to tell the player you will address that during the next session. Try to handle character either at the end or before you start the game, or even better between sessions. Nothing bogs things down more than twenty minutes of characters doing their skill upgrades and figuring out which book has which spells and who is researching what. There are ways to make this interesting but it is a large investment of time, if your game is limited on time you might not want to deal with that at game time. You should give yourself twenty or so minutes before or after the game to handle upkeep. "/>

            <para/>
            <ITEXT CH="It is not easy letting go of the story you are trying to tell. Maybe you have written the story yourself, so you really want the climaxes to have an impact. You have to remember the players are not inside your head. They will not understand certain pieces, they may misinterpret clues, they may put more weight on certain paths of investigation than others, and in a nutshell they just wont behave. Don’t expect them to, expect the unexpected and be ready to change accordingly. Let the players take on some of the storytelling, let them explore, and don’t be upset when they head in the wrong direction. Sometimes the best moments of the game have nothing to do with the plot, and they are remembered for days to come. Finally, and most importantly, have fun."/>

I make them up in my head, I play table top role-playing games in which I make up stories and now I write them for the website. In the past I had never thought I could pursue writing because I figured I would need to hunt down publishers, take classes to learn how to properly write and a host of other things. I came across something that was written by a popular writer whose name I wont mention, but he commented on what one should do to become a writer. He said if one wants to be a writer then you should write. Thats all. Just write and write a lot. You will start off making mistakes and refine as you go. No one can teach you as much as you can learn from just doing it. In this new age of the internet and crowd funded original content the stage is now set for me to do what I have always wanted to do, write. So I take you all along with me on my journey. I am as far from trained and educated as a writer that one could be, but I believe I have stories to tell and so, for better or worse, I will tell them. I only hope to get better and in the process tell some stories that others will enjoy. "/>

If you found this through other channels then the content might not appeal to you, but I have a feeling it may interest you nonetheless. If you are a player of the game then I hope to provide you with additional resources to fill your games, or possibly inspire ideas of your own. The site is focused on the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game and H.P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu Mythos which I have loved since I first read Lovecraft’s work as a young boy. The resources available for the game are all original, created by myself and either used or are planed to be used in my own games. I hope that others will insert this content into their own games and get some enjoyment out of it. "/>

Each months worth of content will be packaged up in the printable version which will be given to supporters and possibly sold on the site, if I can find the time to rig that all up. I will also have special content for supporters from time to time which will appear in the printable version but my not appear on the site.
